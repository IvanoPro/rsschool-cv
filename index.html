                    <p>Working as Junior Front-end developer I seek for an opportunity to grow as a good specialist and to add best value. Briefly about myself: I've worked in different spheres but after a while I understood that there wasn't enough space for growth and that the work was depressive for me. I've always been drawn to programming and now I'm radically changing the course of action. I'm taking advanced Front-end. At the moment I'm looking for a position of Junior Front-end developer. I'm committed to improving my skills and further training.</p>
